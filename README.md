# EDA-and-Prediction-Covid19

We have proposed a system, which uses Linear Regression to predict the number of deaths which can occur due to Coronavirus. The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle which is being updated and maintained by the wonderful team at John Hopkins University. 
The main goal of this project is to try visualize, explore the data and to implement Linear Regression for prediction. We have a dataset which consists of Confirmed, Recovered, Deaths and respective Observation Dates. To implement the algorithm, first we analyzed the relationship between each variable to find out the dependent & independent variables. 
We made three models, the first one which predicts based on Confirmed cases. Second, based on the Confirmed & Recovered cases together and the last model on the product of both. We can say that all the three models were moderately accurate.
